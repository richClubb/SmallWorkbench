# Small Workbench

The point of this workbench is that I wanted to start practicing joinery and I had nothing to hold the pieces. I saw a video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpjD27dUQt8&t=16s and thought it was a great idea. 

There were some things about his design that I didn't like, I wanted to use only wood joints and no metal screws, I wanted to add some weight as I was only using softwood so i ended up using a laminated 2x4 top, and I wanted to try something complex by using mortis and tennon joints and having a mortis through a tennon as well.

## Dimensions

1000 mm long
225 mm wide
500 mm high

Weighs about 20 kg fully assembled using cedar, would be heavier if it was using a hardwood

## Cuts
5 * 1000 mm 2*4 inch
2 * 1000 mm 2*2 inch
4 * 500 mm 2*4 inch
2 * 225 mm 2*4 inch

I got about 6 2400 mm PAR 2*4 inch beams which measured about 45 mm by 100 mm and 2 * 2.4 mm 

## Tools Required

* 19mm (3/4 inch) Forstner bit / Auger bit - Dog holes
* 10mm / 12mm Chisel - Mortis / tennon joints
* Hammer - Obvious
* Glue - Obvious
* Clamps (various sizes) I ended up with a few 300mm and 800mm clamps for the wide pieces and some self made clamps for the longer pieces
* Rip saw (I ended up with a Ryoba which does both Rip and Cross-cut)
* Cross-cut saw (I ended up with a Ryoba which does both Rip and Cross-cut)
* Square
* Ruler

### Optional

* Biscuit jointer / domino jointer - Helpful for locating the large laminated beams
* 12 / 13mm auger bit (getting rid of waste for the mortices)
* Marking knife (good idea)

## Extra Things

* End vice
* Leg vice

I'd recommend getting these for the work holding. They aren't in the CAD but I'm designing these separately.
